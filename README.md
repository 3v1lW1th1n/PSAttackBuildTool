_PS>Attack is currently available as an [beta](https://github.com/jaredhaight/psattack/releases/). You can also download the beta for PS>Punch (the portable environment that PS>Attack customizes) [here](https://github.com/jaredhaight/PSPunch/releases/)._

_These projects are under heavy, active development and should gain features quickly. I'm planning to have "1.0" ready to go early 2016. I'm writing an ongoing series of articles about where this project is at [here](https://www.psattack.com/tags/psattack/)_

_If you have any questions or suggestions for PS>Attack and PS>Punch, feel free to reachout on twitter or via email: jaredhaight `at` prontonmail.com_

## PS>Attack [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/c5v1nxo38a7nec3b?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jaredhaight/psattack)


A platform for generating a portable powershell attack environment (from [PS>Punch](https://www.github.com/jaredhaight/PSPunch/)). The generated environment is a self contained exe and comes with a lot of the latest and greatest offensive PowerShell tools. 

#### What does it do?
PS>Attack handles downloading PS>Punch, downloading updated versions of the modules that it uses (PowerSploit, PowerTools, etc), encrypts them with a unique key and then packages everything up into a self contained exe.

#### What is PS>Punch?
[PS>Punch](https://www.github.com/jaredhaight/PSPunch/) is used by PS>Attack to generate the portable attack environment. PS>Punch combines some of the best projects in the offensive powershell community into a self contained executable. It uses a couple of techinques to evade antivirus and Incident Response teams.

1. It doesn't rely on powershell.exe. Instead it calls powershell directly through the dotNet framework.
2. The modules that are bundled with the exe are encrypted. When PS>Punch starts, they are decrypted into memory. The unencrypted payloads never touch disk, making it difficult for most antivirus engines to  them.
3. When generated by PS>Attack, the payloads are encrypted with a unique key. This means that the generated executable's signature changes each time it's created. 

Offensively, PS>Punch contains commands for Privilege Escalation, Recon and Data Exfilitration. It does this by including the following modules and commands:
* [Powersploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)
  - Invoke-Mimikatz
  - Invoke-GPPPassword
  - Invoke-NinjaCopy
  - Invoke-Shellcode
  - Invoke-WMICommand
  - VolumeShadowCopyTools
* [PowerTools](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools)
  - PowerUp
  - PowerView
* [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang)
  - Gupt-Backdoor
  - Do-Exfiltration
  - DNS-TXT-Pwnage
  - Get-Infromation
  - Get-WLAN-Keys
  - Invoke-PsUACme
* [Powercat](https://github.com/besimorhino/powercat)
* [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)

It also comes bundled with `get-attack`, a command that allows you to search through the included commands and find the attack that you're looking for.

#### Greetz
PS>Attack was inspired by and benefits from a lot of incredible people in the PowerShell community. Particularly [mattifiestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) of PowerSploit and [sixdub](https://twitter.com/sixdub), [engima0x3](https://twitter.com/enigma0x3) and [harmj0y](https://twitter.com/HarmJ0y) of Empire. Besides writing the modules and commands that give PS>Punch it's.. punch, their various projects have inspired alot of my approach to PS>Attack and PS>Punch as well as my decision to try and contirbute something back to the community.

A huge thank you to [Ben0xA](https://twitter.com/ben0xa), who's [PoshSecFramework](https://github.com/PoshSec/PoshSecFramework) was used to figure out a lot of things about how to build a powershell console.
